Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js or AngularJS.

I have no commercial experience with Vue or Angular. But I can tell you about one of my React projects.
The most interesting and challenging application that I worked on was the video+slides presentations recorder, editor and player (SlidePresenter).
The essence of the player is playback video and show slides, annotations, quizzes, navigation by chapters and tracking progress.
Also player supported different layouts, quality and playback speed.
Recorder provided functionality to record media file and put slides during the recording.
Editor provided tools to add or edit slides, annotations, quizzes, chapters and layouts.
