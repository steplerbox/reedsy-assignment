2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?
I enjoy creating tools like described in the first answer.
I'd like to create tools that help end user to do things and also I can use such tools myself.

2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?
I was happy to use <video/>, <audio/> and MediaRecording API instead of old flash implementation.
Also I like canvas and experiment with it sometimes.

2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting innerHTML and using createElement.
createElement creates element of provided type and returns reference to it.
Set innerHTML parses passed string as HTML and adds parsed sub-tree to the target element.

2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.
One-way data binding means that the view always gets data from the model. To update the view need to update the model first and then redraw the view.
Two-way data binding synchronizes the view and the model whenever either change.

2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?
JavaScript is single threaded, it means that one thing can happen at a time and everything else is blocked until an operation completes.
That's why JS provides callbacks mechanism that helps us to avoid blocking of code execution during longtime operations.
